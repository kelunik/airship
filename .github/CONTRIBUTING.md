# How to Contribute

Please make pull requests against the `master` branch. If we need to backport a
bugfix into a different branch, we will take care of that.

If you would like to improve the documentation, you want the 
[documentation repository](https://github.com/airship-docs).

## Current Branches

* `master` is the future home of `v2.x` when PHP 7.1 is released. All active
  development must be against the `master` branch. Changes will be backported
  when appropriate.
* `v1.x` is the home of the `v1.x` branch.
  * Bug fixes will be backported from `master` to `v1.x` during patch releases.
  * UI improvements will be held until the next minor relase.
